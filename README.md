You downloaded a fullset. Congratulations! You now have dozens, hundreds, thousands of duplicate roms. Even if you used my (rom_manager)[https://github.com/kwyxz/rom-manager] which can only work on file name and won't be able to know whether Makaimura and Ghosts'n Goblins are the same game.

Fear not : after scraping those games in ES-DE (you only need to download the game Title + Metadata) this script will be able to tell you which ones are duplicate and give you a chance to delete them. Even better, if some files are missing artwork that is otherwise present for duplicates (think Translations), this script will copy the artwork over.
